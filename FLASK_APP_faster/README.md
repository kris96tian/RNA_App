# RNA Structure Predictor

A web app for predicting RNA secondary structures using dynamic programming. Visualizes structures in **Dot-Bracket Notation** and interactive plots.
(Loads faster than the streamlit deployment)

## Features (same as the streamlit one):
- Predicts RNA secondary structures.
- Interactive visualization with Plotly.
- Base pair details in table format.

## Usage
1. Visit: [RNA Structure Predictor](https://kr1571an.pythonanywhere.com/).
2. Input an RNA sequence (e.g., `AUGCUAGCUAGC`).
3. View structure, dot-bracket notation, and base pairs.
